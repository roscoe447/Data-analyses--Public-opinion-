# PUBLIC OPINION ANALYSIS (AGROKOMPLEX)

The public opinion analysis was carried out using freely available sources. A total of 1,527 respondents participated in the survey, answering a series of questions focused on the use of EU funds and the functioning of the European Union. The goal of the survey was to collect quantitative data about the priorities and opinions of participants.

The data are divided into two parts. The first sheet, titled Data Analysis - Agrokomplex, contains all the questions posed to respondents. For each question, the response options are listed along with the number of votes received and their percentage share. This sheet also includes graphical representations visualizing the distribution of answers. It provides an overall summary of the results from all respondents without distinguishing additional characteristics.

The second sheet, titled Deep Analysis, offers a more detailed view of the results. Here, the data are segmented by age groups, allowing for the observation of differences between categories. For each age group, both absolute numbers and percentages are shown, accompanied by charts. This segmented approach reveals subtle differences that are not visible in aggregate data.

The results should be interpreted as follows: the first sheet provides an aggregated overview of all answers, while the second sheet adds depth through segmentation. Combining both sheets gives a comprehensive picture of participants’ preferences while also showing how these preferences vary across different groups.
